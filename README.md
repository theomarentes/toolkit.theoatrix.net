## Website Description
The Theoatrix Toolkit will allow users to solve complex calculations with the goal of improving their experience playing RuneScape.

### Purpose
In RuneScape, players control a single character, enduring long grinds to increase their skill levels and aquire top tier equipment. The Theoatrix Toolkit will make difficult skill level calculations easier, it will track the userâ€™s progress in the game and track the prices of equipment, using 3 different APIs.

WiseOldMan API: https://docs.wiseoldman.net/

Wiki GE API: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs

Official API: https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/

Our database will store information from these APIs with periodic and user triggered scrapes.

From seasoned players looking for advanced strategies to newcomers eager to navigate the intricacies of the game, Theoatrix's toolkit aspires to be a gaming companion, empowering players at every level.

### Tech Stack
The upcoming Theoatrix RuneScape Toolkit will be developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, will efficiently store diverse user and equipment data.
Express.js will facilitate backend development, integrating with Node.js for server-side execution.
The frontend will leverage React, ensuring a responsive user interface.
The MERN stack will enable real-time updates on in-game progress and item prices. As users explore Theoatrix's guide videos and written content, the MERN stack will give a dynamic experience.

## Application Architecture Diagram

![Application Architecture Diagram](docs/app-architecture-diagram.jpg)

The theoatrix toolkit's architecture is designed to provide Runescape players with a seamless and engaging experience, at the forfront are the clients, accessing the toolkit through web browsers, navigathing through progress trackers and guide. The frontend being powered by ReactJS ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface with modular components for various toolkit selections.

The deployment process is streamlined through netlify, offering a continuous inegration and deployment for the React frontend and Express backend. Express.js plays a pivotal role, managing API routes and serving as the bridge between the React frontend and MongoDB database. MongoDB serves as the core database, storing user progress, equipment data and providing a flexible but most importantly scalable solution.

MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud-based hosting solution, offering scalability, reliability and global distribution for efficient data management. External APIs play a distinct role in enhancing the user experience. These APIs provide real-time skill tracking, live pricing data and skill guides, enriching the toolkit's features.

## User Stories
**Story:** As a low level RuneScape player, I want to see how long it will take me to get to level 99 in magic, so that I can estimate how many months before I can defeat this boss.

**Tookit Feature:** Account Tracker Page

**Description:** The toolkit will allow a player to input their RuneScape name and it will show how long it takes to reach level 99 in any skill.

**Edits:** The toolkit will show the percentage to level 99 however requires too much extra input to work out the time.

---

**Story:** As a player with level 94 crafting, I want to read a crafting levelling guide, so that I can get to level 99 crafting as fast as possible.

**Tookit Feature:** Skill Guides Page

**Feature:** The toolkit will include written guides for every skill in RuneScape, showing how to level up from 1 to 99 (already written).

**Edits:** We decided against adding the skill guides page simply because those guides are already displayed on the base website (theoatrix.net).

---

**Story:** As a player with level 68 smithing, I want to know what levelling method I should be using, so that I can earn coins while I level up.

**Tookit Feature:** Skill Guides Page

**Feature:** The toolkit will include video guides for every skill in RuneScape, showing how to level up from 1 to 99 (already written).

**Edits:** We decided against adding the skill guides page simply because those guides are already displayed on the base website (theoatrix.net).

---

**Story:** As a player with 100 million gold coins, I want to know how much construction experience I can gain by spending it all, so that I can upgrade my player-owned-house.

**Tookit Feature:** Calculators Page -> GP/XP Calculator

**Feature:** The toolkit's gp/xp calculators will allow users to view the cost of levelling. Gp/xp stands for gold pieces per experience point.

**Edits:** Removed GP/XP Calculator due to large amount of data required to function.

---

**Story:** As a player with 4300 hours played, I want to know how many hours are left until I reach level 99 in every skill, so that I can plan ahead with what skills to train.

**Tookit Feature:** Calculators Page -> Time To Max

**Feature:** The toolkit's time to max calculator will allow players to input their RuneScape name and see exactly how many hours remain before they reach level 99 in every skill if they play efficiently. This will be done using the WiseOldMan API.

### Production Testing
For production testing, the toolkit was promoted in the Theoatrix clan chat to more users.

- RuneScape Name: Kandarin
- Testing Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8CBpVcbqyc 
- Testing Comments: "Whenever first logging onto the Theoatrix Toolkit website I was met with a screen where I could input my runescape username. After inputting my runescape username, a bunch of stats as well as trackers were pulled up about my account providing useful information that would not be easily accessible all in one place otherwise. Not only that but signing up for an account was very simple and after signing up for an account, I was able to favorite my account search, making it easily accessible in the future."
