## Website Description
The Theoatrix Toolkit will allow users to solve complex calculations with the goal of improving their experience playing RuneScape.

### Purpose
In RuneScape, players control a single character, enduring long grinds to increase their skill levels and aquire top tier equipment. The Theoatrix Toolkit will make difficult skill level calculations easier, it will track the userâ€™s progress in the game and track the prices of equipment, using 3 different APIs.

WiseOldMan API: https://docs.wiseoldman.net/

Wiki GE API: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs

Official API: https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/

Our database will store information from these APIs with periodic and user triggered scrapes.

From seasoned players looking for advanced strategies to newcomers eager to navigate the intricacies of the game, Theoatrix's toolkit aspires to be a gaming companion, empowering players at every level.

### Tech Stack
The upcoming Theoatrix RuneScape Toolkit will be developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, will efficiently store diverse user and equipment data.
Express.js will facilitate backend development, integrating with Node.js for server-side execution.
The frontend will leverage React, ensuring a responsive user interface.
The MERN stack will enable real-time updates on in-game progress and item prices. As users explore Theoatrix's guide videos and written content, the MERN stack will give a dynamic experience.
