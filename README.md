## Website Description

### Purpose
In RuneScape, players control a single character, enduring long grinds to increase their skill levels and aquire top tier equipment. The Theoatrix Toolkit will make difficult skill level calculations easier, it will track the userâ€™s progress in the game and track the prices of equipment, using 3 different APIs.

WiseOldMan API: https://docs.wiseoldman.net/

Wiki GE API: https://prices.runescape.wiki/api/v1/osrs

Official API: https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore_oldschool/

Our database will store information from these APIs with periodic and user triggered scrapes.

Express.js will facilitate backend development, integrating with Node.js for server-side execution.
The frontend will leverage React, ensuring a responsive user interface.
The MERN stack will enable real-time updates on in-game progress and item prices. As users explore Theoatrix's guide videos and written content, the MERN stack will give a dynamic experience.

## Application Architecture Diagram

![Application Architecture Diagram](docs/app-architecture-diagram.jpg)

The theoatrix toolkit's architecture is designed to provide Runescape players with a seamless and engaging experience, at the forfront are the clients, accessing the toolkit through web browsers, navigathing through progress trackers and guide. The frontend being powered by ReactJS ensures a dynamic and responsive user interface with modular components for various toolkit selections.

The deployment process is streamlined through netlify, offering a continuous inegration and deployment for the React frontend and Express backend. Express.js plays a pivotal role, managing API routes and serving as the bridge between the React frontend and MongoDB database. MongoDB serves as the core database, storing user progress, equipment data and providing a flexible but most importantly scalable solution.

MongoDB Atlas serves as the cloud-based hosting solution, offering scalability, reliability and global distribution for efficient data management. External APIs play a distinct role in enhancing the user experience. These APIs provide real-time skill tracking, live pricing data and skill guides, enriching the toolkit's features.
